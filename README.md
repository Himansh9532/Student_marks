Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment with Python 3.12, follow these steps:

Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd C:\Users\Himanshu\Desktop\student_marks
Create a virtual environment named venv1:

bash
Copy code
conda create -p venv1 python==3.12 -y
Activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
conda activate venv1/
Step 2: Initialize Git Repository
Create a new Git repository and add the README.md file:

bash
Copy code
echo "# Student_marks" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
Add your remote repository on GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin git@github.com:Himansh9532/Student_marks.git
Verify your remote URL:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
Push your changes to the GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Step 3: Develop Project Files
Create .gitignore File: Add files that should be ignored by Git, such as venv/, *.pyc, etc. Example of a simple .gitignore:

markdown
Copy code
venv/
*.pyc
*.pyo
Create requirements.txt: This file should list all dependencies required for your project, e.g., Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, etc. You can create this file manually or run:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Create setup.py: This Python file is used to configure your package. Example:

python
Copy code
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="student_marks",
    version="0.1",
    packages=["student_marks"],
    install_requires=[
        "flask",
        "numpy",
        "pandas",
        "scikit-learn"
    ],
)
Create Source Files: Now, create the following directories and files to structure your project:

src/: Main source folder
components/: Contains the logic for data ingestion, transformation, and model training.

data_ingestion.py: Code for loading and processing training and test data.
data_transformation.py: Code for transforming data.
model_trainer.py: Code for training the model.
pipeline/: Contains pipeline scripts for training and prediction.

train_pipeline.py: Code for training the model.
predict_pipeline.py: Code for making predictions with the trained model.
logger.py: Handle logging for tracking execution.

exception.py: Define custom exceptions for your project.

utils.py: Utility functions for data handling, file saving, etc.

Step 4: Run Your Code
Run the Data Ingestion Script: After writing the code for data ingestion in data_ingestion.py, run it from the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python src/components/data_ingestion.py
Run the Data Transformation Script: Write the code for data transformation in data_transformation.py and execute:

bash
Copy code
python src/components/data_transformation.py
Train the Model: After youâ€™ve written the model training code, run it:

bash
Copy code
python src/components/model_trainer.py
Step 5: Create Flask Web Application
Create Flask App Files:

application.py: This file contains your Flask app and routes.
templates/: Contains HTML templates for your app.
index.html: Landing page.
home.html: Main page for your app.
Basic Flask App Example:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Run Flask Locally: Once the code for your Flask app is ready, run it using:

bash
Copy code
python application.py
Step 6: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Create Elastic Beanstalk Configuration: In your project directory, create the .ebextensions folder:

bash
Copy code
mkdir .ebextensions
Create python.config: Inside .ebextensions/, create a file called python.config:

bash
Copy code
echo "# .ebextensions/python.config" > .ebextensions/python.config
Edit python.config: Open python.config in a text editor (e.g., Notepad or VS Code) and add the following:

yaml
Copy code
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
    WSGIPath: application:app
Deploy the App: To deploy to AWS, first initialize Elastic Beanstalk:

bash
Copy code
eb init
Then, create an environment and deploy:

bash
Copy code
eb create student-marks-env
eb deploy
Access Your Application: After deployment, open your app in a web browser:

bash
Copy code
eb open
Final Check: Structure Overview
Here is what your project structure should look like:

bash
Copy code
/student_marks
    /src
        /components
            - data_ingestion.py
            - data_transformation.py
            - model_trainer.py
        /pipeline
            - train_pipeline.py
            - predict_pipeline.py
        - logger.py
        - exception.py
        - utils.py
    /templates
        - index.html
        - home.html
    - application.py
    - .gitignore
    - requirements.txt
    - setup.py
    - .ebextensions/
        - python.config
    - README.md
Summary
This guide walks you through setting up a Flask application, organizing your code with components and pipelines, and deploying the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Each step outlines how to initialize a Git repository, structure your project, and use the EB CLI to deploy your app.
